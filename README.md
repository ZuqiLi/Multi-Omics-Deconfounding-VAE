MODVAE (**M**ulti-**O**mics **D**econfounding **V**ariational **A**uto**E**coder) is a project proposing four novel VAE-based deconfounding frameworks tailored for clustering multi-omics data. These frameworks effectively mitigate confounding effects while preserving genuine biological patterns. The deconfounding strategies employed include (A) a conditional VAE, (B) adversarial training, (C) removal of latent features correlated with confounders, and (D) adding a regularization term to the loss function.
